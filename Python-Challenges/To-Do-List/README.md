# To-Do-List Web Application (BACKEND CODE)
This folder contains the server side code to a to-do-list application complete with a user signup, user login, create task, view task, edit task, delete task, token generation and token authentication feature that logs data onto a local SQLite development server.

## Setup
NOTE: The To-Do-List.py script is to be executed in a virtual environment with the name env_todolist for the requirements.txt file to be successfully generated as well as all the package dependencies to be successfully downloaded in the virtual environment thus executing the rest of the To-Do-List.py script successfully.
